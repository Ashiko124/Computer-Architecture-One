Explain how the CPU provides concurrency or parallelism:

Describe assembly language and machine language:
Assembly language is a human readable language which is a step up for machine language so that the human has a way to communicate to the computer without using 1 and 0's

machine language is the language that the computer understand and represents having voltage or no voltage on a wire. Typically this voltage is 5vDC but it can also be 3.3V in some cases. A 5v line represents 1 and 0v represents a 0.

Why is 3D performance so much higher with a graphics card than without?
not sure.

Suggest the role that graphics cards play in machine learning:
not sure also.
